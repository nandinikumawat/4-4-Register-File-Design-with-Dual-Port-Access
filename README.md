# 4-4-Register-File-Design-with-Dual-Port-Access
This project implements a fully functional 4×4 register file with independent read and write ports using transmission gate-based D flip-flops, optimized 2-to-4 decoders, and synchronous control logic. The design achieves a maximum operating frequency of 14.53 GHz in TSMC 16nm FinFET technology.
